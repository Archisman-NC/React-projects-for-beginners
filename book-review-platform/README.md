# Book Review Platform

A simple, beginner-friendly React project that demonstrates building a book review platform. This project is part of the "React Projects for Beginners" collection and is intended as a learning exercise to practice building CRUD-style UI, component composition, and basic state management in React.

---

## Project Overview

The Book Review Platform is a small React application that allows users to browse books, add reviews, and give ratings. The aim of the project is to provide a practical sandbox for applying React concepts such as components, props, state, and simple routing or local data persistence.

This project is meant for educational purposes â€” to help beginners gain hands-on experience building a front-end project using React.

## Features

- Browse a list of books
- View individual book details
- Add and view basic reviews/comments
- Simple client-side data handling (local state / localStorage)
- Clean, component-based structure suitable for extension

(Features can be extended with authentication, backend storage, search, filtering, and pagination.)
